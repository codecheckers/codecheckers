# Codecheckers Team

This repo collects all information about people conducting CODECHECKs as part of the [CODECHECK community](https://codecheck.org.uk/guide/community-workflow).

## Find a codechecker

You can take a look at the codecheckers table, [`codecheckers.csv`](codecheckers.csv) to find a suitable codechecker.
GitHub even provides a nice [search function](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data) for the file.
Consider skills earlier in the list to be more advanced, later ones to be less strong.
If you have a good candidate, please check the codechecker is currently not busy with too many CODECHECKs already (see assigned issues in the [CODECHECK register](https://github.com/codecheckers/register/)).

Alternatively, you can @-mention the codecheckers team with [`@codecheckers/codecheckers`](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/teams/codecheckers) in the issue for managing the codecheck and ask around for interested codecheckers by adding `@codecheckers/codecheckers` to an issue comment.

Finally, you can ask the author for recommendations, start an open call for codecheckers on Twitter, et cetera.

## Sign up

If you want to [get involved](https://codecheck.org.uk/get-involved) as a codechecker, we need to run through the following steps:

1. Codechecker (you!) opens an issue **[using this link](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/issues/new?assignees=nuest&labels=registration&template=codechecker-registration.md&title=Register+as+codechecker)** (with an issue template)
2. Community manager makes sure all required information is there
3. Community manager invites the new codechecker to the [Codecheckers Team](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/teams/codecheckers) (Note: the team page is not public)
4. Communtiy manager welcomes the new codechecker
5. Communtiy manager saves information in the "database" and closes the issue with the commit
