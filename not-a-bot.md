Thanks for your interest in becoming a codechecker! :heart:

I invited you to [the team](https://github.com/orgs/codecheckers/teams/codecheckers) and added you to [the list](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/blob/master/codecheckers.csv). Welcome!

We will get in touch when we have a paper matching your expertise, which strongly depends on the ongoing conversations with journals and publishers - we'll keep you posted. Until then, feel free to keep an eye open for interesting preprints in your domain, which you can introduce to a [community CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/guide/community-process). If you're engaged as reviewer, why not suggest a CODECHECK with your next review? If you are editor at a journal, we'd be happy to chat with you about establishing CODECHECKs there! :muscle:

Unfortunately I didn't find an email via your ORCID profile or personal page linked on it - can you please check? Thanks! We simply want another option to reach you besides GitHub.

I'll add you to the list then asap, just ping me here.
